Programming task 5

K-means

Implement k-means algorithm. Program should work for any number of attributes, which is recognized automatically from the data file.

Program should be tested on iris data. Labels should be omitted in k-means calculations and used in calculations of purity.

K is chosen by the user.

After each iteration your program should print:

- sum of distances between observations and their centroids (one value)

- the purity of each cluster, percent of each iris label in each cluster
